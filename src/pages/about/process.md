The OSCQR Process provides a Framework and Dashboard that supports a campus-tailored and scalable approach to improving the instructional design of online or blended courses.

The Framework includes:

- A [Course Review](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4NsbwqHDMBh1Hv1ZVm4D8cbV5nshY7CWatapiMxfRY/edit#gid=188887012) that results in an Action Plan to improve the design of the online course.
- The Course Refresh prioritizes and targets specific improvements suggested in the Action Plan  for improvements.
- A Learning Review that identifies and determines the next set of improvements for continuous online course quality improvement.

OSCQR provides a process, an online dashboard, and interactive rubric to systematically review and refresh the instructional design and accessibility of online and blended courses, as well as complete online degree programs. We invite collaboration and feedback on the use of OSCQR and  input and suggestions from the community.

Working with [multi institutional teams](http://innovate.suny.edu/onlineteaching/meet-the-team/) of SUNY online instructional designers, librarians, distance learning directors, and technologists, the OSCQR team started with the [Chico rubric](https://www.csuchico.edu/eoi/), 20 years of SLN research-informed [best online practices](http://www.slideshare.net/alexandrapickett/online-course-review-checklist), the SUNY office of general counsel’s memorandum on accessibility considerations, and conducted a gap analysis with Quality Matters, iNACOL, and the Blackboard exemplary courses. The resulting rubric was also informed by the Community of Inquiry model (Garrison, Anderson, and Archer, 2000), [The 7 Principles for Good practice in Undergraduate Education](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED282491.pdf) (Chickering & Gamson, 1987), The Adult Learner (Malcom Knowles, 1973), Bloom’s Taxonomy (Bloom et al., 1956) and How People Learn (Bransford et al., 1999), and mapped to the Open SUNY fundamental competencies for online teaching
