## Review These Explanations

Any hardware, software, or technology applications that are required for successful participation in the course need to be introduced along with resources that support a full range of learner mastery. This information needs to be communicated out to learners early on, and reinforced throughout the term.

Hara and Kling (1999) cite that technology problems and ambiguous instructions frustrate online learners. Access issues need to be mitigated early on in order for learners to succeed.

Skill levels need to be established and explained so that learners know what level of expertise is required in order to fully participate in the course. These explanations should include beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels with full descriptions of which features are mastered to which extent at each level. This helps guide learners to appropriate resources to build their knowledge and skill levels. (Leach & Walker, 2001).

If learners are required to use third party content (publisher websites, online labs, assignment utilities, web-based subscriptions), links to associated resources, and explanations on how to access this content need to be included.
