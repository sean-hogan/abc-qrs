## Review These Explanations

SUNY/SUNY Online is committed to using low cost instructional materials wherever possible in order to reduce the financial burden on learners. Open Educational Resources (OERs) are educational materials that are considered to be in the public domain, or have an open use license. This means that anyone can legally use and in some cases adapt and re-share these resources.

OERs are available to support a wide range of disciplines and can take the form of complete textbooks, lectures, assignments, labs, simulations, interactive modules, projects, exams, animations, videos, games, and other course support materials.

There are more than one billion distinct pieces of OER content available (McShane, 2017), so learning how to search and find appropriate resources is key. [SUNY OER Services](https://oer.suny.edu/) offers a ready-to-adopt course catalog, facilitates the seamless integration of openly licensed content into learning management systems, and assists SUNY faculty, librarians, and staff in the remixing of openly licensed content from various sources, and provides access to the offline (print) production of learning materials.

**Open Educational Resources: A Significant Movement in Education**
The global movement of utilizing Open Educational Resources (OER) to enhance or build course content is rapidly growing amongst educators (Hilton, Wiley, Stein & Johnson, 2010). Faculty are using OER to provide access to educational materials at little to no cost, allowing for up-to-date, relevant and accessible content to students.
