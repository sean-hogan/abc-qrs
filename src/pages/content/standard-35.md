## Review These Explanations

Screen readers do not read images, which makes them inaccessible to learners with visual impairments who rely on those readers. If images are used, ALT (alternative) text, descriptive text needs to be provided.

For some images, alternative text is enough. If a complex photograph, chart, or diagram is displayed, visually impaired learners need more descriptive text, including a narrative that explains clearly what the image is and what it represents. In addition, audio descriptions should be provided for any video-only content.

As colleges and university need to be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, those that use the Internet for course delivery must be prepared to delivery those courses through accessible means (Patrick, as quoted in Morris et all, 2016).

In compliance with accessibility guidelines, videos included in online courses need include closed captioning for learners that are hearing impaired. Captions are essential for hearing impaired learners, but are also useful for non-native English language learners who may have trouble understanding complex words.

## Refresh Your Course with These Ideas

- Ask your publisher about accessibility of course materials before selecting your next textbook.
- Check your course content accessibility with the [WAVE checker online](http://wave.webaim.org/).
- For a video of cell mitosis, where there is no narration, just a visual illustration of the process, an audio description is provided.
