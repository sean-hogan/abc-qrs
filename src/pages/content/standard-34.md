## Review These Explanations

Online courses may provide access for a more flexible learning experience for many learners, but the delivery platforms may hinder online courses access for learners with visual impairment, who rely on screen readers to process text (Huss & Eastep, 2016).

Text content is easier for screen readers to process, assuming that it is available in HTML. Instead of displaying as visual content, screen readers convert course text to speech so that learners can listen to the course content. Screen readers insert pauses for periods, semi-colons, commas, question marks, exclamation points, and ends of paragraphs.

Providing content that is accessible is critical to keeping learners with visual disabilities on track. PDF documents are not always designed to be compatible with screen readers. Compatible PDF documents are structured and have a very specific reading order so that assistive devices can translate them effectively.

## Refresh Your Course with These Ideas

- Refrain from using graphic images that include text. If you do use them, be sure to include descriptive ALT (alternative) text to comply with accessibility guidelines.
- Ask for a course accessibility review from your campus accessibility and learner accommodated services staff.
