## Review These Explanations

Instructors need to be aware of the copyright and licensing status on all materials used in their online courses. Copyright infringement happens when works are copied, performed, or distributed without the permission of the copyright holder, or when those actions are not allowed under federal exceptions of copyright law. Understanding copyright and licensing status will guide faculty to make the right choices when integrating resources into their online courses, and to cite those sources properly.

Copyright and fair use can be complicated, and faculty should check with campus librarians for guidance on where to locate the licensing status of all materials, and how to cite and state copyright permissions appropriately.

Resources and materials in the course should all be properly cited. In doing so, instructors and programs model good academic citizenship. This can guide learners to respect the intellectual property of other, and explore effective practices on publishing new materials.

## Refresh Your Course with These Ideas

- Check with campus librarians on copyright and fair use policies, and post these in the course information documents area.
- Have a campus librarian review your online course for copyright and licensing compliance issues.
- Create a video on copyright and fair use guidelines by interviewing your campus copyright expert. Include this in your course information documents area.
- Use a copyright and fair use check list and review your course when you are done developing it. Repeat this checklist review each time you teach the course.
- Explore the possibilities of using a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/) on materials that you create and distribute in your course.
