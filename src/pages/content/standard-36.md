## Review These Explanations

Learners who have low vision or are color blind need high contrast between the text font and background in order to read. Using color as a highlight may not be readable by all learners, and they can miss out on key concepts if only color is used to make specific information stand out.

According to statistics:

- 15% of the world’s population have some form of disability, which includes conditions that affect seeing, hearing, motor abilities and cognitive abilities.
- About 4% of the population have low vision, whereas 0.6% are blind.
- 7 to 12% of men have some form of color-vision deficiency (color blindness) (O’Connor, 2014).

In many cases, these conditions make it difficult to distinguish colors.
