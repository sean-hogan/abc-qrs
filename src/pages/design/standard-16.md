## Review These Explanations

The online course should be designed so that learners can easily navigate and progress through a logical sequence and pace. This is achieved through consistency in layout and delivery of information types in regular order within learning modules.

Organization is one of the most important parts of an online course, and complicated course layout and poor navigation links contribute directly to learner confusion and a poor learning experience overall. (Bristol and Zerwekh, 2011)

The key factor in organization of an online course is consistency — from the overall color scheme and page design to the layout and structure of learning modules, assignments, and rubrics. Redundancy (the same documents appearing in several locations) is favored, as such repetition helps learners navigate easily to relevant information without having to search extensively.

By consistently sequencing online course overviews, content, learning activities, interactions, learners can routinely access what they need within each module, and anticipate where to find new course materials.

Titles and headings that link to learning content, activity, and assessments should detail specifically what the learners will access, including name and file type (if applicable).

## Refresh Your Course with These Ideas

- Create a logical consistent modular course structure.
- Create sequential modules that include meaningful headings that reflect the subject matter covered.
- Download or create a graphic icon set that you can use to guide learners about learning asset types. Assignments can be depicted by a check-mark icon, for example, and discussions by a conversation icon. Use these consistently throughout the course.
- Create your first module and review it with a campus instructional designer or experienced online instructor. Then use this module as a template to create the other modules in your course.
- Create a course design style checklist to keep track of consistent styles and content characteristics in your course. If you use a standard style header in one module, this will help you carry the style through to other modules.

**Applying Motivational Design Principles to Create Engaging Online Modules**
In a classroom setting, levels of learner engagement vary widely, but instructors can adjust the lesson based on the perceived level of learner engagement. However, in an online environment, instructors cannot spontaneously prompt learners to motivate their engagement. When developing asynchronous modules, using a motivational design model and appropriate technologies allows one to replicate a dynamic, active learning classroom environment.

**Create Modules to Organize and Present Content and Learning Activities**
The first step in developing an instructional strategy is to identify a teaching sequence and manageable groupings of content (Dick, Carey, & Carey. 2005). One way to sequence and group content in your online course is to create modules. A module is a unit or section of material within your course that organizes and presents content and outlines the learning activities and assessments for learners over a certain period of time.

Effective Practice from the Online Learning Consortium (OLC)
The University of West Florida (UWF) Academic Technology Center (ATC) developed an online course design template based on the Quality Matters (QM) standards that models a recommended online course structure. The template provides faculty with a straightforward starting point for online course design and a consistent framework based upon nationally recognized quality standards.
