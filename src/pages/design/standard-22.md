## Review These Explanations

Online course content that flashes or blinks can cause seizures for some learners, and should be purposefully avoided. This includes images as well as text. In addition to possibly causing seizures, flashing and blinking text can distract from and disrupt learning.

The Web Accessibility Guidelines published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) clearly state that if content is unsafe if it flashes more than three times per second. In keeping with accessibility guidelines, and for consideration of all learners, do not include any flashing or blinking text.

## Refresh Your Course with These Ideas

- To create highlights or catch attention, use headings, or display fonts.
- If something is critical for learners to grasp, or stop and think about, use graphical elements, such as a stop sign, or question mark.
