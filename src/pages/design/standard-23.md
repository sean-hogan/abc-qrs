## Review These Explanations

Researchers rely on eye gaze tracking as an analysis tool to determine readability. In eye gaze tracking, a camera is focused on the readerâ€™s eyes, tracks where they are looking, and maps the points to how the reader moves through the page. Eye gaze tracking has shown that font size and type face (serif vs. sans-serif) do factor into readability results (Beymer et al, 2008).

Although learners can adjust their screen resolution and font sizes within their browsers, following this guideline will help to ensure readability.

## Refresh Your Course with These Ideas

- Use the default font in the LMS, and take advantage of the set heading styles that you can choose from.
- For any print materials you create, be sure that the text is readable. Print out anything you expect your learners to print to check readability.
- If you use a display font anywhere, be sure that it is readable and accessible on all devices.
- Check the readability of your course on any mobile devices that you have access to.
