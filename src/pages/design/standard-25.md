## Review These Explanations

If you have tabular data that you need to display, you will need to provide a title and summary description in order to guide learners using screen readers through the topic before the screen reader accesses the actual data in the table.

Be sure that the title appears first, the description second, and the table last. The description should include the word “table” so that learners using screen readers will know that a data table will be coming up next in the page sequence.

All data tells a story. You can choose to explain the data itself to your learners, detail why the data is important, ask open ended questions, or summarize each category. Either way, you need to provide an introduction and context to support all learners.
