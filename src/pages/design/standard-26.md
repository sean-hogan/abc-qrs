## Review These Explanations

Tables enable learners to quickly scan and make visual associations between table cell contents and appropriate row or column headings. In order for screen readers to process table information, row and column headers need to be in place. When they are, learners can navigate through table cells one at a time and the row and column headers will be read out to them.

Taking the time to learn how to include these headers within the LMS will make it easier to meet accessibility guidelines and serve all online learners.

## Refresh Your Course with These Ideas

- Keep row and column headers short and simple.
- Listen to how your table appears in a screen reader. [Download a free version of JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS) to understand how course content is accessible to the visually impaired student using this tool.
