## Review These Explanations

Using a consistent layout will set the stage for continuity and consistency in your course. If presenting slides, keep the layout simple and clearly convey the following in your opening slides:

- The main purpose of the presentation.
- Why the material is important.
- How you expect learners to interact with the presentation.

Learning materials presented in slide format work best if the slideshow is considered as a highlight with minimal text that can be supplemented with a content summary provided in handouts or assigned readings (Kinchin, 2006).

## Refresh Your Course with These Ideas

- Use section headers to separate topics within a slideshow or presentation.
- Create a session agenda or outline that matches the title slides and/or section headers.
- Simplify your slides as much as possible, using the notes feature to guide any recording that you might include.
