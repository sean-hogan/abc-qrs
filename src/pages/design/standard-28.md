## Review These Explanations

Transitions have an effect on learner information processing. Researchers conducted a study where learners were split into two groups. One group was shown a presentation with animated, automatic transitions on slides, and the other group was shown an identical presentation with no transitions.

When learners were tested on recall and understanding, the group that watched the presentation with no transitions scored higher (Mahar et al, 2009).

Moreno & Mayer (2000) also found that that irrelevant sounds, motions, or animations in a presentation can reduce learner comprehension.
