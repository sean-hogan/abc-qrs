## Review These Explanations

The code that is used to generate tables on online pages does not work well with screen readers that are used by learners with visual disabilities. Tables tend to distort the information, making it hard to process smoothly, and reading in these situations becomes choppy and distorted.

In order for screen readers to scan code properly, the table needs to be structured properly so that a learner who is blind, low-vision and/or using a screen reader can process the auditory output that is generated.

The Web Accessibility Guidelines published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) refer to these issues with table programming and display as information relationship and meaningful sequence issues that need to be addressed.

To avoid these issues, present information as text in paragraphs, bulleted lists, etc.

## Refresh Your Course with These Ideas

Avoid using tables, but if you do need to display data tables:

- Follow the guidelines for creating an accessible table (See Standard 26).
- Web Accessibility: Tables
- Write a narrative description of the table, and include a link to a downloadable version of the table.
- Listen to how your table appears in a screen reader. Download a free version of JAWS to understand how course content is accessible to the visually impaired student using this tool.

## Example
- Example of a table that is not set up well to be read by a screen reader:
    - [Sample Non-Accessible Data Table in Screen Reader](https://accessibility.oregonstate.edu/sites/accessibility.oregonstate.edu/files/tablenoaccess.mp3)
    - Listen to the way a screen reader processes a table that is not accessible.

If you code tables properly, someone using a screen reader will also be able to scan through the table and understand it.
