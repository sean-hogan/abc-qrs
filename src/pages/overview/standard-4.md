Keeping learners on track is a core part of teaching online, and the more information you can provide in advance, the fewer problems and obstacles your learners will encounter. Creating a syllabus is fundamental aspect of any course design process. Providing a syllabus in a format that is easy to find in the online course, and available for learners to access, download, and print at their convenience is equally essential.

Many learners prefer a document that they can print and refer to offline, or keep for their records. Producing a syllabus in a format that is readable and printable (not editable) is the goal. PDF and HTML file formats are recommended over DOC formats.
