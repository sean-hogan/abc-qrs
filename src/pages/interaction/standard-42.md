## Review These Explanations

Collaboration in an online course fosters constructive learning by enabling learners to be active participants, take initiative, think critically, and engage each other in dialogue. (Palloff & Prat, 2007).

By requiring learners to engage with each other, it requires them to assume more responsibility for their own learning. This often leads to a deeper level of engagement. The instructor’s role is as a facilitator, who moderates and evaluates the quality and quantity of interaction between learners.

Group and peer-review assignments can support social, teaching, and cognitive presences in the online learning environment. According to Lee and Choi (2011), the more instructors promoted interaction through collaboration, feedback, group activities, and peer scaffolding, the more likely that learners persisted and successfully completed their online studies.

Providing opportunities for learners to learn from each other is an integral part of constructive collaboration. Collaborative online learning activities can enable more advanced learners to reinforce and maximize their own abilities and understanding while helping less experienced learners to develop theirs, as they construct new knowledge together (Vygotsky, 1978). This new knowledge can then be shared and infused back into the course learning materials to scaffold other learners to construct new meaning.

### Examples

> “Students in courses where instructors used open-ended discussion prompts and graded students’ posts had higher average final course grades…Rich discussions can enhance learners’ understanding of a topic and should be guided by the instructor.” (Lee & Recker, 2021).

- Use online interaction/discussion strategies that have a positive impact on learner outcomes:
    - Open-ended prompting (like brainstorming questions).
    - Grading discussion posts.
    - Focused discussions, which center around one specific topic.
    - Elaborated feedback, which provide explanations, or additional resources, like hints and extra study materials,
- [Student Led Discussions](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ909855.pdf): Assign a different learner to moderate the discussion forum each module, helping other learners stay on topic and track.
- Hold a formal [debate](https://www.uis.edu/ion/resources/instructional-activities-index/debate/) in the online discussion forum.
- Have learners work in groups to create presentations using VoiceThread, or another collaborative presentation tool.
    - [Presentation Tools: for aysnchronous and synchronous student presentations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kg1nTF1C-SQOrFhJSSPozUTrP13ZESNYjlXTeGLzzek/edit?usp=sharing)
- Create a collaborative sites where learners can engage by sharing and discussing course-related resources. Available tools include [Diigo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YHcoIIdUkLu4I1GE40YBeHH_zYyEIje2m6XhQ1GVA-g/edit?usp=sharing), [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/alexpickett/etap640/), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/list/user_vote/4223288), and [Flipgrid](https://flipgrid.com/257ed6cc).
- Assign [collaborative writing projects](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/bold/tools/collaborative-writing/) with dyads (pairs) of learners and have them work together as a team throughout the term.
- Create a course [wiki project](https://www.uis.edu/ion/resources/instructional-activities-index/wikis/) that involves assigning individual learners to work on specific areas, and the learner group to work on creating a cohesive project.
- Integrate [case studies](https://www.uis.edu/ion/resources/instructional-activities-index/case-studies-case-based-instruction/) that involve [group scenarios](https://www.uis.edu/ion/resources/instructional-activities-index/group-problem-solving/) into discussion forums. Have learners role-play the scenario and then reflect on the decisions of their classmates.

This is especially true for large-size classes. ([Read more …](https://topr.online.ucf.edu/use-online-debates-to-enhance-classroom-engagement/))

**Use Online Debates to Enhance Classroom Engagement**
A debate is a formal competition between two teams, usually with three members each, arguing a discussion statement known as “the moot”. Shaw (2012) believes that debates stimulate critical thinking and can be a highly effective way to actively engage students in research in the online classroom.

**Use Social Bookmarking to Organize and Share Online Resources**
IDL6543 is a professional development course, designed to prepare UCF faculty for a successful online teaching experience. In the course, faculty learn about online pedagogy, online technical and logistical issues, course delivery strategies and tools used in Webcourses@UCF (learning management system). IDL offers tons of resources for faculty to use for their online teaching. The instructional designers compiled lists of resources on Diigo, a social networking site, at http://www.diigo.com/user/onlineucf . Faculty can access those updated resources not just in IDL6543, but also after completing the course. ([Read more …](https://topr.online.ucf.edu/social-bookmarking/))
