## Review These Explanations

All learners need clear guidance on when learning activities and assignments are due, and what they need to do in order to meet those deadlines. Providing guidance on when timed responses are required enables learners to anticipate workload and be better organized.

Instructors benefit from promoting effective time management strategies for learners. In addition to providing information on when timed responses are required, instructors can explain the importance of respecting set deadlines, and the courtesy of timeliness.

If learners are expected to post to discussion forums by a specific day/date and time, that information needs to be clearly detailed in all discussion forum descriptions and overviews.

Understanding learners who need more time for accommodations or extraneous circumstances is critical to promoting learner success in online courses. Some learners may require more time to complete timed exams, or read and post to discussion forums.

## Refresh Your Course with These Ideas

- Create a downloadable/printable weekly checklist with details on what is due each day of the week during each course module.
- Set up an automated email that reminds learners at least one day in advance that they need to respond or take action in the course by a specific date/time.
- Create a link to the course messaging area that is prominently displayed on assignment or activity pages that require timed responses. From there, learners can send a message quickly to inform you if they are going to miss a deadline.
- Highlight specific days/dates and times in module overviews or weekly announcements that remind learners to respond or post on time.
